OOPS object oriented programming system

-->


<!--

OOPS

{
	variables  // data members
	
	functions  // members functions
}


Object-oriented Programming treats data as a crucial element in program 
development and doesn't allow it to flow freely around the system.

It ties data more securely to the function that operates on it and protects it 
from accidental modification from an outside function. 

OOP breaks down a problem into several entities called objects and 
builds data and functions around these objects. 


Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP provide securities 
OOP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and 
shorter development time


There are certain features or mechanisms which make a 
Language Object-Oriented like:

OOPs Concept in JavaScript

Classes  => { block }
Object   => access of block properties we create object of class
Encapsulation
Abstraction	
Inheritance	
Polymorphism

<!--
Classes :: making group of data member(variable) and member function 

In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. 
We can define the class just like function declarations and function expressions.

The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including 
methods or constructor. The class is executed in strict mode. So, the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.

The class syntax contains two components:

Class declarations
Class expressions


Real Life Objects
In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.

Here is a car object example:

-->


<script>
/*
simple()
	{
		var a=10;
		var b=20;
		var sum;
		sum=a+b;
		document.write(sum);
	}
simple()
*/

class abc{   // class declared by class keywords

	sum()
	{
		var a=10;
		var b=20;
		var sum;
		sum=a+b;
		document.write(`${sum}<br>`);
	}
	multi()
	{
		var a=10;
		var b=20;
		var multi;
		multi=a*b;
		document.write(multi);
	}
}
//create instance of class => oject// by object we can access all properties of class
var obj=new abc;   
obj.sum();
obj.multi();
</script>
