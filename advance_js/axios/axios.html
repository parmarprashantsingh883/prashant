<!--
Axios is an open source library that allows you to make HTTP requests. 
It provides methods that include .get(), .post(), and .delete().

In this article, you will build a JavaScript application that uses Axios to perform GET, 
POST, and DELETE requests to a server for updates to a list of todo items.
1️⃣ What is Axios?

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for browser and Node.js.

It allows you to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests easily.

Returns a Promise that resolves to a response object.

Key difference from fetch:

Axios automatically parses JSON, while fetch requires response.json().

Axios automatically throws errors for HTTP status codes outside 200-299.

Supports interceptors, request/response transformations, timeouts, and cancellation.
